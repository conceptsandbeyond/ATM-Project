Lab 2 - Step Definitions

<p> 

## <b>**Writing step definitions for your scenarios**</b>


This project builds upon ATM00 by providing the feature file and step definitions, but without implementing the actual ATM code logic. This demonstrates writing tests first without writing the actual application logic.

1. Make sure you are in your branch - feature/Student\<team number\>

2. Navigate to folder ATM01


3. Open file - ATM01\Tests\Features\ATMOperations.feature

This file should have the scenarios predefined 

4. Open and review the file ATM01\Tests\StepDefinitions\ATMOperationsSteps.cs

this file should have two step definitions written already for review. You will need to add the rest of the definitions. Work within your team to define rest of the step definitions



Once all the definitions are added you can run the tests now.

Navigate to the ATM01 folder and run the tests now. Run the following commands.

```
cd ATM01
dotnet test
```

Commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "adding Step definitions"
```


## Simulating the tests within step definitions


1. Navigate to Folder ATM02


2. Open and review the file ATM02\Tests\StepDefinitions\ATMOperationsSteps.cs



Navigate to the ATM02 folder and run the tests now. Run the following commands.

```
dotnet test
```

Commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "adding Step definitions"
```
