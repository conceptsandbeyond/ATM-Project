Lab 3 - Adding application code

<p>



## <b>**Writing function to pass the test cases**</b>


**Working Directory - ATM03**


This project builds upon ATM02 by adding the actual functions that are targets for the test cases written in previous lab. This demonstrates writing tests first without writing the actual application logic.


1. Open file - ATM03\SRC\ATM\ATM.cs

This file should have the class "ATM" predefined. Add the application code to to pass the tests you wrote in the previous lab.


Once the application code is added you can run the test by running the following commands in terminal.

```
dotnet test
```
