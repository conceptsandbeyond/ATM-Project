Lab 3 - Adding application code

<p> 

## <b>**Writing function to pass the test cases**</b>


This project builds upon ATM02 by adding the actual functions that are targets for the test cases written in previous lab. This demonstrates writing tests first without writing the actual application logic.

1. Make sure you are in your branch - feature/Student\<team number\>

2. Open in folder ATM03

3. Open file - ATM03\SRC\ATM\ATM.cs

This file should have the class "ATM" predefined 


this file should have two step definitions written already for review. You will need to add the rest of the definitions. Work within your team to define rest of the step definitions



Once the application logic is added you can run the tests.

Navigate to the ATM01 folder and run the tests now. Run the following commands.

```
dotnet test
```

Commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "adding Step definitions"
```
