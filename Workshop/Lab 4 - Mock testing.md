Lab 4 - Adding mock functions

<p> 


## <b>**Writing function to pass the test cases**</b>

This project builds upon ATM03 by introducing Moq testing for mocking certain dependencies. It includes the feature files, step definitions, fully implemented ATM operations, and Moq-based unit tests.


1. Make sure you are in your branch - feature/Student\<team number\>

2. Open in folder ATM04

3. Open file - ATM03\SRC\ATM\ATM.cs and review the ATM logic

This file should have the class "ATM" predefined 


this file should have two step definitions written already for review. You will need to add the rest of the definitions. Work within your team to define rest of the step definitions



Once the application logic is added you can run the tests.

Navigate to the ATM01 folder and run the tests now. Run the following commands.

```
dotnet test
```

Commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "adding Step definitions"
```
