Lab 4 - Adding mock functions

<p> 


## <b>**Writing function to pass the test cases**</b>

This project builds upon ATM03 by introducing Moq testing for mocking certain dependencies. It includes the feature files, step definitions, fully implemented ATM operations, and Moq-based unit tests.


1. Make sure you are in your branch - feature/Student\<team number\>

2. Open in folder ATM04

3. Open file - ATM03\SRC\ATM\ATM.cs and review the ATM logic

4. Open file - ATM04\SRC\Main\IAccountService.cs to review the moq integration logic

5. Add step definitions in this file - ATM04\Tests\StepDefinitions\ATMOperationsSteps.cs





Once the application logic is added you can run the tests.

Navigate to the ATM04 folder and run the tests now. Run the following commands.

```
dotnet test
```

Commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "adding Step definitions"
```
